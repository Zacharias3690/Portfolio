## Me
My name is Zach Barnes. I have a ~~obesssion~~ passion for coffee and food. I'm a front end web developer currently based in Charlotte, but I love
Austin, Denver, and Los Angeles.

## What I do
I have a passion for architecting and building UI frameworks. I enjoy the back and forth between design and development,
and the ability to make a designers creations come to life.

## My skills
I would consider myself an expert in Javascript, and very strong in CSS and HTML. Recently I've been building in Vue.js,
but I have 4 years experience with Angular, and have built some side projects in React.
